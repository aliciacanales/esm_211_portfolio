## two event mark recapture experiment. on marked species
## power calculations
## calculate recommended sampling size
## type of conservation models -- used to estimate the numerical counts of something
## estimates the current population size with a measure of uncertainty
## can also be used to justify sample size
## type of data -- number of animals marked on the first visit, second visit, and recaptured animals that were marked
## common in fisheries

## Example
## get an estimate and put a bound on it
## data intensive and has lots of uncertainty
